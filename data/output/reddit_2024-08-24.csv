I know it's not a huge amount, but I've been interested in Bitcoin since I was about 11, thanks to Steam accepting it in 2016. At the time, I really wanted to buy the game Euro Truck Simulator 2 on Steam, but my parents were strongly against video games and never allowed me to get it. In my search for a way to buy the game, I came across Bitcoin and tried to mine it using Nicehash on my PC. I was so excited that I told my dad, but unfortunately, he ended up taking away my PC. These days, my dad acknowledges that he was wrong, but he was concerned that I was being scammed.

Since that experience, I've always wanted to buy Bitcoin, and I finally did. I want to share my achievement with others, but this time, I‚Äôd like to keep it a bit more private. That‚Äôs why I decided to post here. And I want to thank the five people who will read this! :)"

1ezpnml,"How many of you truly understand the driving factors in post halving ""bull markets""?",191,99,Smooth_Talk,2024-08-23 22:25:53,https://i.redd.it/vu0rk9o0phkd1.jpeg,False,False,False,False,6952943,"It's no secret that 500-550 days post halving Bitcoin tops out at some astronomical number compared to the last bottom price. It's no secret that fools rushing in to buy an asset at an all time high price helps propel this growth, but that's not the driving factor.

The global economy and global liquidity are the leading factors driving these bull markets. Bitcoin's value is a reflection of fiat currency inflation and economic production. The more money the world prints the more we see Bitcoin rise in value. When you consider the scarcity of Bitcoin it makes sense that this would serve as a hedge against inflation in some way, like gold but not exactly like gold. 

Attached is a chart displaying this correlation between the price of Bitcoin and 2 economic indicators
-United States ISM Manufacturing New Orders
-United States ISM Purchasing Managers Index
There's much more evidence to support this supposition but if you can't believe it based on this chart you won't believe it at all.

1ezlf6m,There's a massive rug-pull on the horizon....,169,210,None,2024-08-23 19:25:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ezlf6m/theres_a_massive_rugpull_on_the_horizon/,False,False,False,False,6952943,"In the US, legal claims to ownership of securities belong to the very top of the economic food chain, not the individual. The legal framework that allows for this is VERY sophisticated, has proven case law and is unlikely to get rervesed anytime soon. This is mostly due to a change in the UCC section 8 from 1994. See https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/8

Assets (including stocks, bonds, homes, pension funds, ETFs...) are collateralized (unknowingly) by third parties. Meaning, if there were a financial collapse, these third parties would go bankrupt and the legal claims to collateralized assets would go to the very front of the those in line. In othewords, there's no counter party. This is designed to occur (literaly) overnight.  

This mattters to Bitcoin because of the ETFs. Anyone who ""owns"" shares of a Bitcoin ETF, IRA or hold bitcoin in a custodian will lose most if not all value in a financial collapse. Most of which will go to the creditor(s) first in line. This includes Blackrock. 

How many here are aware of this?

They have a record of you buying x btc, you made a withdrawal, and on their traceable record you now have 0, the difference between BTC when you brought it then withdrew it will now get legally stolen,

As far as I'm aware in my country you only need to pay capital gains when selling the crypto for fiat or other cryptos and not when it's still in the same coin so I still wouldn't be required to pay tax if it's still just BTC"

1ezudwm,Anyone familiar with transaction trading works? ,2,9,Memory-Reboot-84,2024-08-24 02:09:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ezudwm/anyone_familiar_with_transaction_trading_works/,False,False,False,False,6952943,"I have an older friend who met some guys from some exchange that talked him into spending a thousand bucks on a 60 second transaction on a node.

He made money from the transaction, and now they are telling him he has to do another ""100% funds investment"" in another transaction (on a node, I guess) in order to withdraw his total to Coinbase?

I am trying to help him and understand what is going on, but I don't know anything about this stuff. I just DCA & HODL, so I don't do these node transaction ""investing"", so I'm not sure if he's betting on the probability a block hash gets figured out or a transaction gets verified or whatever within a minute or what. 

The exchange is apparently called Cexff Com & I've never heard of it.

Any advice or further reading materials or videos would be greatly appreciated. He apparently spent money he shouldn't have been gambling with, so I'm hoping this doesn't end up a tough lesson for him.

Thanks in advance!



Edit for more info:  I asked him if he could transfer his funds to another exchange or wallet, and he said he tried sending them to Coinbase, but it wasn't allowed. His money is in USDT right now & he's expected to do another trade, but the tech support guys he was speaking with became unresponsive.

He was apparently waiting on them to tell him which transaction to place his money on. These were in BTC he said."

I have reviewed Bitcoins cycles due to the halving, its volatility (life force), and its typical 3 year up, 1 year down pattern.  Examining the Priced in Bitcoin21 website (https://www.pricedinbitcoin21.com/landing) I know that my daily expenses will become infinitely cheaper especially over a 3+ year period if they are priced in Bitcoin.  For this reason I am plotting the following strategy that I invite criticism for because I will consider comments and adjust my strategy as I see fit.  

The plan:

I will embark on 4 years of austerity.  I will save every fiat dollar I can in two wallets.  Wallet 1 will be a Trezor of Ledger where I hold my private keys on a safe deposit box and utilize this cold wallet strictly for long-storage (HODL‚Äôing).  

I will manage my second daily expenses Wallet on a Coinbase account because Coinbase produces easy to use tax documents at the end of the year.  I will save as much as I can from each paycheck over a four year period.  On year 5 I will begin drawing from Year 1 of my Coinbase savings deposits.  I will use these withdrawals only to pay daily expenses, utility bills, etc.  at the same time I will continue saving my fiat in Bitcoin.  Year 6 would be the same except I‚Äôm withdrawing the Bitcoin I purchased 4 years earlier in Year 2 (and no more).  Even in the down cycle years where the market crashes I should be withdrawing Bitcoin that was purchased at a lesser cost from the previous downturn than the market bottom we experience 4 years later.  I believe that this plan will eventually allow me to save in Bitcoin and always pay my expenses at an 80 to 90 percent discount than that experienced by fiat slaves who will be smacked around by inflation.  

Thoughts?"
