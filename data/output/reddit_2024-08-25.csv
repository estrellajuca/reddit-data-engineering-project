Over the past seven months I‚Äôve had to pay my bills from the rises and falls of bitcoin. I‚Äôve had to pay for internet bill and the cheapest possible food by slowly selling my sats. 

Few months ago, my computer monitor went poof and I had to replace it. Thanks to a local BNPL service, I was able to split the purchase into three months installments which I slowly paid off by selling my sats. 

Today I clear the debt of the replacement monitor by selling my last sats. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to continue but I know someday I‚Äôll remember this day and smile with tears in my eyes.

I have never really had one because honestly I was too lazy to try to start my own business.  I'd rather go to work when I have to and come home when I am done and RELAX.  I hear about people doing small start ups and putting a huge amount of blood, sweat, and tears into them and always felt like kind of a loser because I didn't care that much to do something similar.
  
The other day I realized something after hearing yet another interview with a guy on the radio who was working his ass off trying to get his own company underway.  He started in one field but it failed because he sucked at it.  But it also presented another opportunity that he and his wife seemed to be good at.  So they shifted direction and are now doing that.  But it could also fail no matter how much work and time they devote to it.  Because the market they are in can be pretty unstable over time.  One bad year could close their business for good.
  
I was beating myself up in my head over it yet again but then it hit me: **bitcoin** is my side gig.  And it required a LOT less work and no trying sell a product, stocking inventory, getting business loans, writing up business plans, trying to figure out who to hire, trying to figure out who to fire, filling out complicated taxes (yet), always being the slick salesman look for an edge, renting a storefront, paying utilities for that storefront, or any number of other bullshit things I do not want to deal with after a long day at work.
  
Stacking sats is easy, actually fun, interesting, literally risk free with my hardware wallet, takes only minutes per week, and is funded with the spare cash I have from my normal job that I would otherwise end up spending on some useless shit that I do not need.  And I think it has a hell of a lot more potential for a payout in the end than trying to sell the latest widget craze to a fickle purchasing public.  
  
So always remember: bitcoin is your side gig and Satoshi is your silent partner!"

They have a record of you buying x btc, you made a withdrawal, and on their traceable record you now have 0, the difference between BTC when you brought it then withdrew it will now get legally stolen,

As far as I'm aware in my country you only need to pay capital gains when selling the crypto for fiat or other cryptos and not when it's still in the same coin so I still wouldn't be required to pay tax if it's still just BTC"

I have reviewed Bitcoins cycles due to the halving, its volatility (life force), and its typical 3 year up, 1 year down pattern.  Examining the Priced in Bitcoin21 website (https://www.pricedinbitcoin21.com/landing) I know that my daily expenses will become infinitely cheaper especially over a 3+ year period if they are priced in Bitcoin.  For this reason I am plotting the following strategy that I invite criticism for because I will consider comments and adjust my strategy as I see fit.  

The plan:

I will embark on 4 years of austerity.  I will save every fiat dollar I can in two wallets.  Wallet 1 will be a Trezor of Ledger where I hold my private keys on a safe deposit box and utilize this cold wallet strictly for long-storage (HODL‚Äôing).  

I will manage my second daily expenses Wallet on a Coinbase account because Coinbase produces easy to use tax documents at the end of the year.  I will save as much as I can from each paycheck over a four year period.  On year 5 I will begin drawing from Year 1 of my Coinbase savings deposits.  I will use these withdrawals only to pay daily expenses, utility bills, etc.  at the same time I will continue saving my fiat in Bitcoin.  Year 6 would be the same except I‚Äôm withdrawing the Bitcoin I purchased 4 years earlier in Year 2 (and no more).  Even in the down cycle years where the market crashes I should be withdrawing Bitcoin that was purchased at a lesser cost from the previous downturn than the market bottom we experience 4 years later.  I believe that this plan will eventually allow me to save in Bitcoin and always pay my expenses at an 80 to 90 percent discount than that experienced by fiat slaves who will be smacked around by inflation.

And then writes their id on a big wall...

so every one can see who they are and who they kicked in the balls, in order from first to last...

(1 -) The last person they kicked gets to pick who they kick next...

(2 -) And so that person gets a swift kick in the jimmy...

(3 -) The public board gets updated... and once again everyone knows where the kickers area and who got kicked.  
Return to (1 -)

Thus can't fake a bit coin

Make sense now?"
